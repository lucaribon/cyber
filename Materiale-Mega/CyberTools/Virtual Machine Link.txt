The OVA image already contains most of the tools we will use during the course, including docker, which might create problems for some of you.

Before you begin:
- Download the .ova file
- Open VirtualBox under the "Files" tab
and select "Import Virtual Machine"
- Import the .ova file
- Before starting it, select on "Settings"
and then click on "Network" and enter "NAT"

This should be enough to start the VM.

Common VM problems and fixes:

Virtualization not supported by host machine -> Enable it in your bios settings
Network error -> Change network adapter to NAT
Screen is small -> Change resolution directly in the VM after login
People with M1 macs can use the UTM app (https://mac.getutm.app/) to create an Ubuntu arm virtual machine.
Just use the Ubuntu server arm image and install Ubuntu Desktop with "sudo apt-get install ubuntu-desktop"
